# NER Label Training with SpaCy
This repository contains code for training a Named Entity Recognition (NER) label using SpaCy. The code demonstrates how to train a custom NER model with a new label, specifically "TOOL", using existing pre-trained models.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- SpaCy library
- Install of pretrained German model "de_core_news_sm" or use trained model in this repo for predictions: "de_core_news_sm_with_TOOL"


## Usage
1. Training data directory holds the different CHATGPT generated datasets in individual python scripts. The scipts are later imported into the imrpove_model.py script for training.

2. Trained models directory stores the model after each training cycle (overwritten)

3. Evaluation reports stores all the autogenerated evaluation metrics every time evaluation.py is run.
